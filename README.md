# Journal Checker Tool API

This software provides the API for the Journal Checker Tool.

Plan S aims for full and immediate Open Access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications from research funded by public 
and private grants. [cOAlition S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) is the coalition of research funding and performing 
organisations that have committed to implementing Plan S. The goal of cOAlition S is to accelerate the transition to a 
scholarly publishing system that is characterised by immediate, free online access to, and largely unrestricted use and 
re-use (full Open Access) of scholarly publications.

The Journal Checker Tool enables researchers to check whether they can comply with their funders Plan S aligned OA 
policy based on the combination of journal, funder(s) and the institution(s) affiliated with the research to be 
published. The tool currently only identifies routes to open access compliance for Plan S aligned policies.

This is a [cOAlition S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) project.
